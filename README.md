# string-tuna 🐟

A terminal-based ~~instrument~~ ~~bass~~ 4-string bass guitar tuner.
Because my clip-on tuner ran out of battery, and things ...spiraled...

## Usage

Run
```bash
tuna # the name is already taken on crates.io but I really like this name so I'm keeping this binary name
```
and pick an input device (currently only tested on the Fender Mustang Micro).

## Features

- [x] Tunes my bass
- [ ] Tunes my bass through microphone input
- [ ] Tunes guitars
- [ ] Tunes somebody elses instruments

## Roadmap

Would be fun to:
- have something that monitors plucking volume and tempo consistency
- further optimize the pitch detection algorithm
- use this as a platform to play with Rust's GUI options
